# Web Swing Mechanic üï∏
This project is a simple demonstration of a physics-based web swing mechanic I designed to emulate the movement seen in the spider 
man franchise. I made this for my CMP302 module at Abertay uni, and used Unreal Engine 5 with C++ (no blueprints) to implement it. 
The physics were custom made for this project by me, and I had a lot of fun developing the feel of the swinging motions 
as you move around the test scene.

## The Development Process üõ†

### üéÆ An Unreal Experience
The first step in development for this project was learning Unreal Engine 5. This module left us to our own devices mostly in terms 
of learning, which meant that this would be a test of my research skills. Unfortunately, an immediate barrier to learning showed 
itself as early as the first google search: a lot of the C++ information seemed to get lost in the swamps of blueprint tutorials.

Unreal Engine was very new to me and was completely different compared to the Unity I had some more experience with - which was my 
only frame of reference for a game engine. It felt quite important that I find at least a beginners guide of some sort, which went
beyond the blueprint functionality and into the setup for coding. I will admit that I tried - again - to lean on ChatGPT to sidestep
this learning process and - again - was burned when it couldn't complete the complex tasks I asked of it. It did a bad job, none of 
it worked, and I quickly realised that if I wanted this project to go anywhere I had to get off that path and take a new one. This
was my last time truly trying to use ChatGPT to avoid having to think. It failed me every time I leaned on it to hard, and it was 
clear that for complex tasks it was just not up to snuff. Not to mention, using it was not as enjoyable or fulfilling as working it 
out myself, even when it worked. 

### üìö The Learning Process
In the end, I settled on my solution. I would learn to use Unreal Engine through a tutorial on how to make a grappling hook (available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvKfbWPu79w)) and perhaps some other general tutorials. After I felt like I understood that, 
I would then move on to leaning more on documentation and creating my own effects. 

This was my first time really planning my learning, which was spurred on by the horrific start to this project with ChatGPT and 
general failed learning, and it actually went incredibly well. I plan on making a project in rust some time soon, and I hope to be 
able to plan a path of how to learn for that in a similar way thanks to my experiences with this.
