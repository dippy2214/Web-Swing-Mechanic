# Web Swing Mechanic 🕸
This project is a simple demonstration of a physics-based web swing mechanic I designed to emulate the movement seen in the spider 
man franchise. I made this for my CMP302 module at Abertay uni, and used Unreal Engine 5 with C++ (no blueprints) to implement it. 
The physics were custom made for this project by me, and I had a lot of fun developing the feel of the swinging motions 
as you move around the test scene.
