# Web Swing Mechanic
This project is a simple demonstration of a web swing mechanic I designed to emulate the movement seen in the spider man franchise. 
I made this for my CMP302 module at Abertay uni, and used Unreal Engine 5 with C++ (no blueprints) to implement it. The movement
physics were custom made for this project by me, and I had a lot of fun developing the feel of the swinging motions as you move
around the test scene.
